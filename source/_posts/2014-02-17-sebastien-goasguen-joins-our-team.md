The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has asked Sebastien
Goasguen (sebgoa) to join us as a committer and a PMC member. We are pleased
to announce that he has accepted.

Sebastien is no stranger to the Libcloud project. He has been contributing and
actively participating in the Libcloud community for quite a while now.

On top of that, he is also a PMC member at the Apache CloudStack project and
our local "CloudStack guy".

We are happy to have him and some direct CloudStack expertise in our team.
