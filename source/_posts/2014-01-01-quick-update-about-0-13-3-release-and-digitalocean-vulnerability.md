This is a quick update about the recent 0.13.3 security release and the
DigitalOcean vulnerability.

DigitalOcean updated their blog post. The updated post says that
scrubbing is now enabled by default for all the newly issued destroy
requests:

> All Destroys Default to Scrub
>
> We have updated the destroy method to scrub on all destroys, both for
> web and API requests.

This means that no action is required on the client side and upgrading
to 0.13.3 should not be necessary anymore.
