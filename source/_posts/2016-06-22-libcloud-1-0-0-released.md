### Important breaking change-  Amazon EC2 driver changes

The Amazon EC2 API was updated to consolidate the regional-based drivers into a single driver with a region argument in the constructor.

Amazon Instances should now be instantiated using the following syntax:

```python
from libcloud.compute.types import Provider
from libcloud.compute.providers import get_driver

cls = get_driver(Provider.EC2)
driver = cls('access key', 'secret key', region='us-east-1')
```

This brings the Amazon API inline with the other drivers, makes it easier to maintain and switch between regions.

### Bug fixes

#### General

- Fix a bug with consuming stdout and stderr in the paramiko SSH client which
  would manifest itself under very rare condition when a consumed chunk only
  contained a single byte or part of a multi byte UTF-8 character.
  [Lakshmi Kannan, Tomaz Muraus]

- Increase default chunk size from ``1024`` to ``4096`` bytes in the paramiko
  SSH client. This results in smaller number of receive calls on the average.
  [Tomaz Muraus]

- Fix to Dimension Data API address for Middle-East and Africa
  (GITHUB-700)
  [Anthony Shaw]

- Throw a more user-friendly exception on "No address associated with hostname".
  (GITHUB-711, GITHUB-714, LIBCLOUD-803)
  [Tomaz Muraus, Scott Crunkleton]

* Remove deprecated provider constants with the region in the name and related
  driver classes (e.g. ``EC2_US_EAST``, etc.).

  Those drivers have moved to single provider constant + ``region`` constructor
  argument model.
  [Tomaz Muraus]

### New or deprecated drivers

#### Compute

- Deprecated IBM SCE, HP Helion, OpSource, Ninefold and CloudFrames drivers, removed
  driver code and tests.
  (GITHUB-701, LIBCLOUD-801)
  [Anthony Shaw]

- Introduced error messages (`libcloud.compute.deprecated`) for deprecated drivers
  (GITHUB-701, LIBCLOUD-801)
  [Anthony Shaw]

- New Compute drivers- BSNL, Indosat, Med-1, NTT-America, Internet Solutions
  (GITHUB-700)
  [Anthony Shaw]

- New driver for Aliyun Elastic Compute Service.

  [Sam Song]

#### Storage

- Added Outscale storage driver
  (GITHUB-730)
  [Javier M. Mellid]

- New driver for Aliyun OSS Storage Service.
  (LIBCLOUD-802, GITHUB-712)
  [Sam Song]

#### Loadbalancer

- New driver for Aliyun SLB Loadbalancer Service.
  (LIBCLOUD-802, GITHUB-712)
  [Sam Song]

#### DNS

- Added NearlyFreeSpeech.net (NSFN) driver
  [Ken Drayer]

- Added Lua DNS driver
  [Oltjano Terpollari]

- Added NSOne driver
  [Oltjano Terpollari]

## Bug fixes

  connection class is correctly set to the hostname.
  [Tomaz Muraus]

- Fix handling of ``MX`` records in the Gandi driver.
  (GITHUB-718)
  [Ryan Lee]
  

## Improvements

### Compute

* Introduce new `list_regions` class method on the base driver class. This
  method is to be used with provider drivers which support multiple regions and
  ``region`` constructor argument. It allows users to enumerate available /
  supported regions.
  [Tomaz Muraus]

- [dimension data] added support for VMWare tools VM information inside list_nodes responses
  (GITHUB-734)
  [Jeff Dunham]

- [ec2] added ex_encrypted and ex_kms_key_id optional parameters to the create volume method
  (GITHUB-729)
  [Viktor Ognev]

- [dimension data] added support for managing host anti-affinity rules, added paging support to
  all supported calls and added support for requesting priority ordering when creating ACL rules
  (GITHUB-726)
  [Jeff Dunham]

- Addition of Dimension Data Australia federal government region to dimension data
  drivers.
  (GITHUB-700)
  [Anthony Shaw]

- [openstack] when creating floating IPs, added pool_id as an optional argument
  (GITHUB-725)
  [marko-p]

- [google compute] Added setMachineType method to allow for changing sizes of instances
  (GITHUB-721)
  [Eric Johnson]

- [google compute] allow bypassing image search in standard project list
  (GITHUB-713)
  [Max Illfelder]

- Add support for requesting a MKS token for accessing the remote console in VMware
  vCloud driver
  (GITHUB-706)
  [Juan Font Alonso]

- Add support in VMware vCloud driver for v5.5 API, with snapshot support
  (GITHUB-658)
  [Juan Font Alonso]

- Added support for adding a family to an image on Google Compute Driver
  (GITHUB-704)
  [Max Illfelder]

- Fix to set default signature version for AWS Seoul region to v4, removed
  non-supported size (hs1.xlarge)
  (GITHUB-684)
  [Geunwoo Shin]

- Support filtering by location in list_nodes for dimension data compute driver
  fix lack of paging support
  (GITHUB-691)
  [Jeff Dunham]

- Support for filtering by IPv4, IPv6, network, network domain, VLAN in Dimension
  data driver.
  (GITHUB-694)
  [Jeff Dunham]

- Added `Node.created_at` which, on supported drivers, contains the datetime the
  node was first started.
  (GITHUB-698)
  [Allard Hoeve] [Rick van de Loo]

### Storage

- Improvements to Google Auth for Storage and Compute and MIME bug fix
  (LIBCLOUD-800, GITHUB-689)
  [Scott Crunkleton]

- Implement ``get_container``, ``get_object`` and ``upload_object_via_stream``
  methods in the Backblaze B2 storage driver.

  Note: Backblaze API doesn't upload streaming uploads so when using
  ``upload_object_via_stream`` whole file is read and buffered in memory.
  (GITHUB-696)
  [Jay jshridha]

### Backup

- Dimension Data - added additional testing, fixed bug on client response naming,
  added support for adding backup clients to a backup enabled node.
  (GITHUB-692, GITHUB-693, GITHUB-695)
  [Jeff Dunham]
