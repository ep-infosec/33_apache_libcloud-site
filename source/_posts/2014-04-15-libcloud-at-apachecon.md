During that week multiple presentations about Libcloud took place. In
this post I'm including links to the slides of some of those
presentations:

* [Apache Libcloud by Sebastien Goasguen][3] - Sebastien had a great introductory
  presentation about Libcloud. His presentation also included a great demo
  of using Libcloud's deploy_node functionality to deploy a Worpdress blog on
  Exoscale.
* [Mobile, multi-cloud management on top of libcloud by Dimitris Moraitis][5] -
  Dimitris presented how they utilize Libcloud at [mist.io][5].

*I was also supposed to deliver a presentation about Libcloud's history,
evolution and lessons learned, but due to severe tonsillitis which has been
strecthing for over 3 weeks, I sadly had to cancel my talk.*
