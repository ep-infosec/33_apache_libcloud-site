Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member [Clemens
Wolff][1]!

The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Clemens
Wolff to join us as a committer and we are pleased to announce that he
has accepted.

Clemens has participated in the Libcloud community for a while now and during
his participation he made a [number of high quality contributions to the
project][2].

For anyone who would like to know more about Clemens here is his short bio:

> Clemens Wolff is a tech lead in Microsoft’s Commercial Software
Engineering team, enabling customers from around the world to create scalable,
resilient and efficient software solutions applying relevant technologies and
platforms, including cloud computing, highly scalable data engines, machine
learning and analytics, and distributed messaging systems.

And in his own words:

> I was introduced to Libcloud while working with a research group at Imperial
College London on porting OKpy, an open source computer science classroom
management system, from GCP to Azure. OKpy uses Libcloud which made
migrating the object storage needs of the application a breeze. Since this
initial exposure, I’ve been using Libcloud on many projects to ensure
cross-cloud compatibility and to simplify testing via the local provider
implementations. Most of my contributions have been about maintaining and
updating the Azure implementation of Libcloud’s storage driver and
building test automation to ensure that Libcloud can seamlessly be used
with Azure.

We are happy to have him in our team and we are looking forward to his future
participation and contributions.
