On July 23nd of this year it will be exactly 5 years from the initial project
announcement on the [Cloudkick blog][3].

We are going to celebrate this great milestone with a cake and drinks and we
would like to invite you to join us. The celebration will take place in a nice
bar during the [EuroPython week][2] in Berlin, Germany.

  <p class="img-caption">The cake is not a lie!</p>

Celebration will be attended by Libcloud developers so this is also a great
opportunity for you to meet and hang with us in real-life and ask any questions
you might have about the project.
