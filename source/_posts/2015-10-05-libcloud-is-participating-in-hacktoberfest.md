Github and DigitalOcean are organizing [Hacktoberfest][1] again this year.

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software where people
are encouraged to contribute to different open source projects. Each user who
submits four pull requests to any Github hosted open source project of their
choice will receive a free t-shirt.

This year we are also happy to announce that we have been selected as one of
the highlighted Python projects which users are invited to check, play with it
and contribute to.

We think this is a great opportunity for both, long time users and contributors,
but especially people who are new to open source to learn how open source works
and participate.

Having said that, we would like to invite anyone who is interested to participate
and contribute to our project. You can find more information on contributing to
Libcloud in our [contribution guide][4].

For more information about the Hacktoberfest project itself and information on
how to sign up, please visit the [official website][1] and announcement blog post
from [Github][3] and [DigitalOcean][2].
