Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member [Miguel Caballer][1]!

The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has invited Miguel
Caballer to join us as a committer and we are pleased to announce that he
has accepted.

Miguel has been part of the Libcloud community for many years now and during
his participation he made various contributions to the project, majority of
them focusing on our OpenStack drivers.

For anyone who would like to know more about Miguel here is his short bio:

> Miguel Caballer is part of the Grid and High Performance Computing group of
UPV since 2001. He is the lead developer of the Infrastructure Manager (IM),
a tool that deploys complex and customized virtual infrastructures on IaaS
Cloud deployments. He has participated in different research projects about
the application of Grid and Cloud computing techniques to several areas of
engineering. Other fields of interest include green computing.

And in his own words:

> When I start the development of the IM (in python) I found that Libcloud was
the best option to connect with different cloud back-ends using a single
library and using the same basic set of functions calls. It has improved a
lot in the last years adding extra functionality for each connector that makes
it a really good alternative to native libraries. My main contributions has been
mainly related with the OpenStack driver, one of the most user cloud providers
by the IM tool. I'm very proud to be an Apache Libcloud team member and I will
continue with my contributions.
