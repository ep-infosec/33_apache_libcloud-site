Please help us extend a warm welcome to our newest team member Eric Johnson!

The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Libcloud has asked Eric
Johnson to join us as a committer and a PMC member and we are pleased to
announce that he has accepted.

Eric has been involved in the Libcloud community for a while now. He has made
many substantial contributions to the Google Compute Engine drivers. On top of
that, he also contributed to other projects which utilize Libcloud.

We are happy to have him on our team and we are looking forward to even better
and more complete Google Compute Engine drivers.
